# Django starter project

Use this project to start off on a Django backend with REST framework. The docker compose setup will start a PostgreSQL instance with Postgis enabled and the settings are connected to this database by default.

### Usage

Clone the starter project to your device:

`git clone https://github.com/Mobiux-Labs/starter-project-django.git`

- Build docker containers. This is a one time process only.
  `docker-compose up --build`
  This command may require elevation to `sudo`.

- For all future instances you can just
  `docker-compose up`
  This command may require elevation.

- To enter the server shell:
  `docker-compose exec server /bin/bash`
  This command may require elevation.

- Set up localsettings.py file in `apiserver/apiserver`:
  `touch apiserver/localsettings.py`
  You need to then import localsettings at the end of apiserver/settings.py file. `from .localsettings.py import *`
  This is already part of the .gitignore and ensures that data(secrets) stored in the localsettings are not exposed to the git repository.

- **Project secret key setup** This step is a must for every project.
  (In the server container shell)
  `python3 -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'`
  Store this 50character string in variable `SECRET_KEY` in localsettings.py.

- Install python Black formatter in your editor.
  Follow the instructions based on the editor you are comfortable using.

- Setup your project virtual environment using `python -m venv venv` in the root
  directory. Read more about venv and how to activate it
  [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Install all python
  packages used in the project from the requirements folder using the command
  `pip install -r /apiserver/requirements/dev.txt`

- Check your version of pre-commit with `pre-commit --version`. You still need
  to activate the pre-commit hooks using `pre-commit install`.

- Alter the /sonar-project.properties file with a new token and project id.
  Set up a few basic branches like dev. Sonarqube workflow will run on this branch.

## Congratulations, You have now set up your starter project üëç
